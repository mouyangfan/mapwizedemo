# The simplest possible app to display a Mapwize map using our latest MapwizeForMapbox plugin on Android

Are you looking for the basic step to integrate Mapwize in your app? This is the perfect place to start.

All you need is:

- An application where you set your Mapwize account
- A layout where you include a Mapbox MapView
- An activity where you add the MapwizePlugin on the map when the map is ready.

When the app loads, you will be able to see the public venues on Mapwize. Simply zoom in to enter them and start navigating indoor.

## Crendentials

You will need to set your credentials in MapwizeSimpleApplication and MapActivity.

Sample keys are given for Mapwize and Mapbox. Please note that those keys can only be used for testing purposes, with very limited traffic, and cannot be used in production. Get your own keys from [mapwize.io](https://www.mapwize.io) and [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com). Free accounts are available.
